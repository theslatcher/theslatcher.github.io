title: Hello World!

Hello and welcome to my Dev Blog where I will chronicle the development of my game(and the engine, and editor that I'm creating for it) that I'm creating using C++ simply called 'Janus', a character-action 2D game in the style of games like Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance, Bayonetta, & Devil May Cry. I've spent around 2 weeks of work on it so far, and mainly been working on the groundwork, but will start working on the actual game & gameplay now.

As for what middleware it uses(or in the case of Sol2 & FMOD; will use): Box2D for the physics, Directx11 for graphics, Lua using Sol2 for the scripting, dearIMGUI for the editor, FreeType2 for font rendering, & FMOD for the audio.

As for the editor at its current shape looks like this:

In the editor I can currently create & modify entities and sprites, import textures, and open a level(or map, depending on what you want to call it) to place entities from the Asset Browser into it.

I believe that's it for now, my goal is to keep on working on this little project of mine and regularly post updates, thoughts, and maybe even write about some things that I find should be more readily available or explained more in detail than they are right now on the internet. Goodbye for now!
