title: Belated Update
---

It has been a while since my last update, I have mostly worked on the engine & editor side of things to prepare for gameplay logic, so here's a list of what I've been working on:

* Texture assets are now able to store the texture data in their files instead of referencing an external file.
* Assets are now able to display their thumbnails in the content browser, and the general layout of them is now fixed.
* You can now filter assets in the asset browser.
* dearIMGUI's docking beta is implemented
* Sprite Animations(non-skeletal) are now supported and there's an editor for editing them.
* Ability to render a grid in the level view/editor.
* Implemented [BalazsJako's ImGuiColorTextEdit](https://github.com/BalazsJako/ImGuiColorTextEdit) to edit & save lua script files in the editor.
* Adding support for Sol2 in the engine.

And to cap it off with a picture of the editor, which looks even better now if I may say so myself:
